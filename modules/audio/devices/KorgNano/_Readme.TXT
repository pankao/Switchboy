This pakage is for an easy use of the Korg Nano Kontrol MIDI controller.

First MAP the MIDI channels with an easy 'point and click' mapping with simulation.
This will create a textfile, wich you can use in the Korg Nano Kontrol MIDI Output.
Included is 3 ways to seperate the MIDI data.

- Open MIDI Mapping.v4p
- Map your 4 scenes and save the file
- Open Korg Nano Kontrol MIDI Output.v4p
- Start having fun with your Korg Nano Control !!

Any question, PM user West @ the vvvv forum!!

UPDATE AUGUSTUS 2011

I add the new Sysex node for Automatic Scene Detection.
